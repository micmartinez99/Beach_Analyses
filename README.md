# Beach_Analyses
Analyses for NIH PREVENT and Ifetroban projects

# 001_PREVENT_Library_QC.R
Contains the code to collate htseq-generated counts tables into a cohesive counts file and perform basic library QC metrics. Data include samples derived from wild-type (WT) rats, normal and tumor tissue from Pirc rats, normal and tumor tissue from treated rats (treatment groups include the following: Naproxen, EPA, combination of Naproxen + EPA, TP252, Combination of TP252 + Naproxen, and Ifetroban.)

# 002_Exploratory_PCA.R
Code used to generate a PCA plot of all tumor samples and a PCA plot of all normal samples

# 003_NControl_vs_WT.R
Analyses to compare normal control Pirc tissue relative to WT rats

# 004_NNaproxen_vs_NControl.R
Analyses to compare normal tissue from  naproxen-treated Pirc rats relatve to normal tissue of non-treated pirc rats

# 005_NEPA_vs_NControl.R
Analyses to compare normal tissue from  EPA-treated Pirc rats relatve to normal tissue of non-treated pirc rats

# 006_NCombo_vs_NControl.R
Analyses to compare normal tissue from  Combination-treated Pirc rats relatve to normal tissue of non-treated pirc rats

# 007_TControl_vs_NControl.R
Analyses to compare tumor tissue from non-treated Pirc rats relative to normal tissue of non-treatmed pirc rats to asssess gene changes in tumorgenesis. 

# 008_TNaproxen_vs_TControl
Tumor counterpart of script 004

# 009_TEPA_vs_TControl
Tumor counterpart of script 005

# 010_TCombo_vs_TControl
